# Key Wheel [[Demo](https://ccorcos.github.io/key-wheel/)]

This is a visualization of my friend Sean O'Reilly's math paper about music and
group theory. It shows the relationship between various scales based on
single-note half-step substitutions.

Currently we're only representing scales that have 7 notes with no more than 1
half-step in a row and no steps more than a whole step.

## What's Next

* [] label all the scales and all the notes
* [] render pentatonic scale
* [] select a subset of a scale to get a chord
* [] rotate the scale to play the same chord in different modes
* [] rotate the chord to play a different inversion of the same chord

* [] create a 3d visualization with melodic scales (allowing gaps of 2)

- using cubehelix with a rotation of two so similar colors are a 4th/5th away.
	pretty cool!
