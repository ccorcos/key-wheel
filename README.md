# Key Wheel [[Demo](https://ccorcos.github.io/key-wheel/)]

A friend of mine did a math thesis about group theory applied to musical scales. This is an interactive visualization showing all 7-note scales (that are a subset of the 12-note diatonic scale) that have gaps no bigger than 2 and clumps no bigger than 2.
